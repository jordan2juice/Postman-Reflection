Each API needs certain things to get the information that is needed. My API was not query-based but still needed certain parameters to get the data that was needed.  
My API asked me for a location a day one and day two.  The "day two" gives the API a range of days to present the information. If I didn't give all the parameters. I
would get an error stating that I entered a bad request.
