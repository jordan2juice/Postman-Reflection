I used "Visual Crossing Weather" for my API.  I used Gatlinburg, TN for my location. above are the initial data and objects for the API.  It shows latitude, longitude, address, timezone, and days.

## Days

For the days it has the date and weather information such as temp, feels like, humidity...

## Summery

Each API needs certain things to get the information that is needed. My API was not query-based but still needed certain parameters to get the data that was needed.  
My API asked me for a location a day one and day two.  The "day two" gives the API a range of days to present the information. If I didn't give all the parameters. I
would get an error stating that I entered a bad request.

Then I added the token to Postman as a variable in my Environment. I also created a base URL variable and got access to my account on GitHub.

Then from here, I started to add a repo to my GitHub account. Using the base URL I did user/repos.  

In the raw body, I put in a name, made it public, and gave it a description.
