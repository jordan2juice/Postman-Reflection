I used "Visual Crossing Weather" for my API.  I used Gatlinburg, TN for my location. above are the initial data and objects for the API.  It shows latitude, longitude, address, timezone, and days.

For the days it has the date and weather information such as temp, feels like, humidity...

## Summery

Each API needs certain things to get the information that is needed. My API was not query-based but still needed certain parameters to get the data that was needed.  
My API asked me for a location a day one and day two.  The "day two" gives the API a range of days to present the information. If I didn't give all the parameters. I
would get an error stating that I entered a bad request.




# Day 4'
Using Postman I can access my user info with a bearer token in GitHub.

Then I added the token to Postman as a variable in my Environment. I also created a base URL variable and got access to my account on GitHub.

Then from here, I started to add a repo to my GitHub account. Using the base URL I did user/repos.  

In the raw body, I put in a name, made it public, and gave it a description.

I had to post the request to Github via Postman and it was successful.
